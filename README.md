# SM Nationalturnen Wollerau 2026

This is the official website for SM2026 Wollerau, hosted at [sm2026wollerau.ch](https://sm2026wollerau.ch).

## About

This website was designed by Adrian Ulrich and developed by Ivo Cavelti. It's built using [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/), a
fast and modern static site generator. The site uses a custom design without any external themes. All layouts and
styles were created specifically for this project.

## Development

### Prerequisites

- [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/installation/)

### Local Development

To start the development server with live reload:

`hugo server -D`

This will start a local server at `http://localhost:1313/` with draft content enabled.

### Production Build

To build the site for production:

`hugo --minify`

This command will:

- Generate the static site in the `public` directory
- Minify all HTML, CSS, JS, JSON, XML and SVG files
- Prepare the site for deployment
